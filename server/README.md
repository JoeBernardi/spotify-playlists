** Notes

- The API response from Giphy is pretty complicated (my guess: needing to support legacy clients), so in the name of trying to get the best performance, I looked at the URLs of the gifs featured in the actual Giphy trending page (https://giphy.com/explore/trending) and tried to gather which types of gif are actually in use.
